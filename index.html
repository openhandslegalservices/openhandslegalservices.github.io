						<p>In 1975, Joseph was convicted of attempted robbery in the 3rd degree at the age of 17. Adjudicated as a youthful offender, he was sentenced to five years of probation. He has no other criminal history, has attended seminary, has served as a deacon and assistant pastor at Christ Church and as a Rikers chaplain, and has started a family. Still, he almost lost his job due to this offense.</p>

						<p>Christian T. Becker is a partner at Kasowitz Benson Torres &amp; Friedman LLP. His practice focuses on white collar criminal defense, internal investigations, and complex commercial litigation. He has been involved with Open Hands Legal Services since 2013 after finding out about our work through Hope for New York, an organization that supports us.</p>
						<p>Christian also serves as an elder at Redeemer Presbyterian Church.</p>

						<p>We applied for a pardon for Joseph under the Governor's recent youthful offender pardon announcement and requested expedited review. We also obtained pro bono counsel through Mr. Becker and his firm. After much work, they ultimately helped Joseph get his job back. We're thankful for God's faithfulness!</p>

					<div class="content">
						<p>Elsa lives in Harlem in a rent-controlled apartment. As rents around her increase, so does pressure to leave. Elsa's landlord has failed to complete serious repairs, even though the Department of Buildings mandated them two years ago. Her landlord also wrongfully combined her electricity box with another apartment so that she was left with an electricity bill she couldn't pay.</p>

						<p>Elsa's case is typical of the harassment that vulnerable tenants may experience. Sadly, in many cases, behavior like this is unchecked because tenants cannot afford to obtain legal consultation.</p>
						<p>Already past the age of retirement, and living in a city where affordable housing is increasingly hard to find, it is essential that Elsa can stay in her home and that it remains a safe place to live. </p>

						<p>Candace started volunteering with Open Hands in 2013 and has become one of our most loyal supporters. She’s dedicated thousands of hours to our clients, not only at the Community Hope Center in East Harlem, but also at the Father’s Heart in East Village, the Relief Bus in East Harlem, and the New York City Rescue Mission in Lower Manhattan. She is one of the many volunteers who helps Open Hands meet clients right where they are.</p>

						<p>We’re working with Elsa to correct her erroneous electricity bill and to deal with the $1000 of wrongful debt she has incurred because of it. Elsa can rest assured that her electricity will not be shut off. </p>
						<p>We're also educating and advising Elsa on how to go about obtaining the repairs to which she's entitled. Surrounded by advocates, she no longer feels pressured or intimidated.</p>
